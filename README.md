# Password-Generator

This project is titled "Password Generator" and is a web application that users can utilize to generate a random password. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a prompt will appear asking the user to enter how many characters they would like their password to be. If a number outside of the 8-128 character requirement is entered, an alert will pop up informing the user to enter a valid input. Once a correct input is entered, a series of confirms will display asking the user whether they would like to inlude special characters, numbers, and uppercase/ lowercase letters. Upon answering the last confirm, a random password will appear in the text box with the users desired amount/type of characters. To make this application functional, many JavaScript components were needed such as functions for generating random character types, for loops, conditionals, and prompt/ confirms.
